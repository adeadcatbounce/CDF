A cumulative distribution function tells you the P(X <= x).
We can denote P(X <= x) using F(x). It tells us the probability that a random variable takes a value less than or equal to x.
In our case, it would tell us the probability that the closing price (each day) of TSLA is less than or equal to x - for the data between 01/2020 and 01/2024.
Based on the plot below, the probability that the closing price of TSLA is <= $ 250 is 0.5, where the probability that the closing price is <= $ 450 is 0.99
